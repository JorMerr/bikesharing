# Citibike NYC Analysis

## Overview of the Statistical Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to determine trends in Citibike bicycle sharing usage from New York City, and apply those findings to possible enterprise in Des Moines. Analysis will be performed on data collected from [Citibike System Data](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data), for the month of August 2019. The data analysis will be performed using Tableau Public and will be made available for review on the [Tableau Public Website](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jordan.merritt/viz/CitibikeNYCAnalysis-August2019/CitibikeAnalysis?publish=yes).
## Results

## Summary
Initial findings of the statistical analysis show that the majority of trips are less than 30 minutes in duration. This suggests bicycle pick up and drop off locations must be created with length of trip duration in mind. The peak trip duration of all users is approximately 5 minutes. This means that many, smaller locations for start and end of bicycle trips will be preferable in order to effectively service users in Des Moines.
